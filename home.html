          <h2 class="heading-box">MY STORY</h2>
          <p>Hello! I'm a rising senior from Brooklyn, NY. As an aspiring software engineer, I'm currently learning front-end web development and applying to college for computer science. I strive to specialize in human-computer interaction and redefine the way humans interact with Artificial Intelligence.</p>

          <h2 class="heading-box">MY PROGRESS</h2>
          <p>It all started in 10th grade AP Computer Science A that I developed an interest in coding. I learned Java in the class and did pretty well. However, I strived to learn more and tried to self-teach Java outside the classroom, but I diverted to Python instead. I learned basic data structures and algorithmic problems through Python, but I decided I wanted to learn more practical things. Hence, my journey into front-end web development.</p>

          <h2 class="heading-box">MY HOBBIES</h2>
          <p>Aside from coding, I have a variety of other hobbies. This includes sports, mainly basketball, track, and powerlifting. Relaxing with my favorite TV shows and movies, alongside discovering new music that becomes my personal soundtrack, are also some of the things that bring me genuine joy.</p>
